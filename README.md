# GoLangTrainers
On my journey to learn Go Lang, I figured I would create a simple service that attached to a MongoDB database and can create, update, delete and find Pokemon trainers (random idea).

This was after about 2 weeks of learning Go for a new project at work and I went home one day and decided to see what I can remember.
MongoDb isn't usually the database I'd use on a day to day basis, but I figured it would be good to learn a NOSQL database as well. 

The hardest part about this project was configuring Go with Mongo on windows. There was a lot of errors I discovered during the setup and documented my process throughout (I would have a DockerFile in this project, but it also didn't work for my pc)

I created an Ubuntu VM in order to redo this project, but I got sidetracked and it never happened.
